# Similarity_of_music_tracks
 The calculation of the value of the similarity metric of musical compositions occurs by transforming the input music tracks into frequency form using the discrete Fourier
 transform: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform. Further, the formation of a logarithmic musical spectrum of a musical work takes place, taking into account
 the physiology of a person's perception of certain sounds: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber–Fechner_law. After the formation of the musical spectra of musical compositions
 and obtaining the corresponding densities of probability distributions for the matrices under consideration, the Kullback-Leibler distance between the distributions is 
 calculated: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback–Leibler_divergence. From the obtained values of the distance by averaging, the very value of the similarity of musical
 compositions is obtained. A more detailed description of the developed algorithm for determining the similarity metric of musical compositions is located in the folder
 "documents" of this repository.
