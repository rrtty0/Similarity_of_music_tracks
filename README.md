## How It Work
 - The calculation of the value of the similarity metric of musical compositions occurs by transforming the input music tracks into frequency form using the [discrete Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform).
 - Further, the formation of a logarithmic musical spectrum of a musical work takes place, taking into account [the physiology of a person's perception of certain sounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weberâ€“Fechner_law).
 - After the formation of musical spectra of musical works and obtaining the corresponding density of probability distributions for the considered matrices, the [Kullback-Leibler distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) between them is calculated.
 - From the obtained values of the distance, by averaging, the very value of the similarity of musical works is obtained. A more detailed description of the developed algorithm for determining the similarity metric of musical works can be obtained from the author by contacting him by mail: mikhail.chaykin.99@gmail.com.
 - The "music" folder contains pieces of music for testing the developed algorithm.
